- 👋 Hi, I’m @Hawkeye2300
- 👀 I’m interested in creating modifications to Linux Mint to contain and limit firmware virus damage. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning learning about a secure virtual keyboard
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on adding to Linux Mint Wilma:
-         1) A secure virtual keyboard mic+camera off, screen capture off, mic+camera off, randomizable on demand,
               implemented in Linux Mint as early as possible to protect the encryption password.
-         2) Automatically identifying a firmware virus attempts to contact its external servers,
               then denying the protovirus outgoing access to those servers
          3) Automatic setup of Tripwire, if it remains useful.
          4) Modification of Wireshark for automatic detection of bad actors, as can be done, to include on a block list,
          5) Creation of a full Installation of Linux Mint ISO copied to a NEXCOPY write-protected bootable USB drive
               with considerations for cache and swap space (TBD).
               Nexcopy write protection is created in Windows at the hardware level, and is more secure than
               standard, physical, switch-protected USB drives. See Nexcopy,com for two forms of write protected USB drives.
